# Manual Assessment Memo
# MEMORANDUM  

**TO:** CEO of Lenovo

**FROM:** Elvie Valmores

**SUBJECT:** Review of Lenovo ThinkPad P16 G2 Manual

**DATE:** February 13, 2025  

I evaluated the manual for the **Lenovo ThinkPad P16 G2**, available at:  
[Lenovo ThinkPad P16 G2 Manual](https://www.manua.ls/lenovo/thinkpad-p16-g2/manual)

The manual has many strengths. The manual has an organized table of contents that allows users to quickly find the section that is needed. The manual also makes great use of labeled diagrams. A good example of this is found in the external ports and input/output functions section on page 12. The troubleshooting section of the manual also does a great job at providing step-by-step solutions to common hardware and software issues such as power failure and display issues. Another nice touch are the direct links to Lenovo's online support because it gives ease of use for users who need additional help.

Even though there are many things that the manual does right, there are also many things that the manual could improve on. Some of the sections in the manual use technical language that could be too difficult for a beginner to understand. For example, the BIOS settings explanations include terms like "UEFI Secure Boot" and "Intel AMT" without clear clarification. Also, the manual directs users to Lenovo’s support website for driver updates but does not explain how to determine which updates are necessary. The manual lacks a sufficient amount of information about how to use Lenovo-specific software. An example of this is not understanding how to optimize system performance in Lenovo Vantage, which limits the user’s ability to fully utilize the device’s features.

In order to improve the manual, the following are my recommendations: 

- Make the technical words easier to understand or include a glossary for complex terms somewhere in the manual. 
- Make detailed step-by-step instructions for advanced settings, particularly in BIOS navigation and system recovery.
- Provide more comprehensive details on Lenovo Vantage, focusing on customization and security settings.
- Make the troubleshooting section better with real-world examples and step-by-step solutions to common user issues.
