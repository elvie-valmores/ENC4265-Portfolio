# Manual Assessment Memo
# MEMORANDUM  

**TO:** CEO of Lenovo
**FROM:** Elvie Valmores
**SUBJECT:** Review of Lenovo ThinkPad P16 G2 Manual
**DATE:** February 13, 2025  

I evaluated the manual for the **Lenovo ThinkPad P16 G2**, available at:  
[Lenovo ThinkPad P16 G2 Manual](https://www.manua.ls/lenovo/thinkpad-p16-g2/manual)

The manual has many strengths. The manual has an organized table of contents that allows users to quickly find the section that is needed. The manual also makes great use of labeled diagrams. A good example of this is found in the external ports and input/output functions section on page 12. The troubleshooting section of the manual also does a great job at providing step-by-step solutions to common hardware and software issues such as power failure and display issues. Another nice touch are the direct links to Lenovo's online support because it gives ease of use for users who need additional help.

While the manual is thorough, certain sections use overly technical jargon that may be difficult for beginners to grasp. For example, the explanation of "Focus Stacking" briefly describes the feature but does not break down how users should adjust focus differentials effectively. Similarly, the "Post Focus" function is introduced on page 131 without a detailed walkthrough on selecting the best frame from a sequence of images which leaves users to experiment rather than follow structured guidance. Some menu settings, such as "Depth From Defocus" (DFD) and "Custom Multi Auto-Focus" (AF), are described in highly technical terms without any real-world examples, making it challenging for amateur photographers to understand when and why they should use these features. While the troubleshooting section is useful, it could benefit from more practical examples of user errors that may cause common problems, helping users diagnose issues more efficiently.

To improve the manual, I recommend the following modifications: 

- Simplify technical jargon or include a glossary for complex terms somewhere in the manual. 
- Provide step-by-step examples for features like "Focus Stacking" and "Post Focus" to make them more accessible.
- Expand explanations of advanced settings such as "Depth From Defocus" and "Custom Multi AF" with practical applications.
- Add more troubleshooting scenarios that reflect real-world user errors and solutions.
