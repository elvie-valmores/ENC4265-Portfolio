## Initial Thoughts

When first looking at the GNLIB (Graphic Novels in Libraries) website, it is clear that it differs from what a modern-day website looks like. Evidently, as shown in the image above, the website's landing page contains a large amount of text with a plain background. The page also lacks a visually appealing design.

It is difficult to navigate through the website because all the text links are the same—they are blue, underlined, and have the same font size. What stood out to me the most was the lack of images or graphics, and the website is very slow at loading pages when using the text links. 

## Modern vs. Early Web Design

- Layout and Navigation: The GNLIB's website uses a collection of text links scattered throughout the page to help the user navigate through the pages. This forces the user to go through a clutter of links, which creates a frustrating and challenging experience for users to navigate through the website. Modern-day websites offer navigation menus, often placed at the top or the side of the page. These menus help the user easily navigate through the website.

- Typography and Contrast: The GNLIB's website has small, inconsistent text that lacks proper spacing. The text colors also blend into the background, which may make it difficult for the user. Modern-day websites utilize larger, well-spaced fonts and high-contrast colors to make text stand out against the background, which will enhance the user's overall experience.

- Visual Appeal: The GNLIB's website has little to no graphics or images. This makes it feel that the website has no identity. The layout feels cluttered, and there is barely any use of white space. Modern-day websites have visually appealing designs with many images and graphics, which clearly show the identity of the website to the user.

## My Experience

Overall, my experience using this website felt weird and unusual. When using the website, I realized how much we take modern-day websites and all their new features for granted. It felt jarring to use a website that lacked usability and visual appeal. This made my experience frustrating because it required extra effort to navigate through the page. Some of the norms that we expect websites to have are navigation menus, fast response times, and efficient use of white space.

## Assessment of Crutchfield’s "How to Install a Car Stereo"
*(https://www.crutchfield.com/S-GLAv1c6udsU/learn/learningcenter/car/car_stereo/installation_guide.html)*


## Effective Aspects:

### 1. Clear Step-by-Step Instructions
The guide makes it easy for beginners to follow, since it is organized into straight-forward steps. The phases are detailed and each are provided with practical advice. The structure of the guide makes sure that the users can follow it easily without feeling overwhelmed.

### 2. Visual Diagrams
One of the biggest strengths of this guide is the inclusion of images and diagrams. These visuals turn complex steps into something easier for the user to understand. A good example of this was the visual diagram of the wiring connections.

### 3. Tool and Parts List
The manual provides a list of necessary tools and parts. This part of the manual is essential, since it helps prevent delays caused by missing equipment. The guide also provides the purpose of each tool.

### 4. Troubleshooting Section
The troubleshooting section of the guide helps users with common issues that they may encounter. Some of the common issues that the user may experience are poor sound quality or non-functioning head units. Offering solutions in advance saves users time and frustration.

### 5. Link to Additional Resources
The guide uses links to relevant Crutchfield products and expert support, which helps the users needing further assistance or additional components. This feature provides easy access to supplemental materials.


## Areas for Improvement:

### 1. More Detailed Wiring Explanations
While the guide includes basic wiring instructions, it assumes a level of familiarity with car electronics. For beginners, a more detailed explanation of wire colors, harness adapters, and soldering techniques would be beneficial. Additionally, a short video tutorial embedded in the guide could further clarify this process.

### 2. Vehicle-Specific Considerations
The guide provides a general approach to stereo installation, but some vehicle models may require additional steps. A section with links to vehicle-specific installation guides would improve the user experience by addressing different dashboard configurations.

### 3. More Emphasis on Safety Precautions
While the guide mentions disconnecting the battery, it could expand on other safety precautions, such as handling electrical components and avoiding damage to factory wiring. A dedicated safety checklist would help the guide, greatly.

### 4. Mobile-Friendliness
Given that many users will reference the guide while working on their vehicles, a more mobile-friendly layout with collapsible sections or a downloadable PDF version would be useful for on-the-go access.


## Final Thoughts:
Overall, the Crutchfield Car Stereo Installation Guide is well-structured, informative, and has many visual diagrams. It does a great job in breaking down the installation process into clear steps while offering troubleshooting solutions and additional support. However, improving the wiring instructions, providing vehicle-specific customization options, expanding safety details, and enhancing mobile accessibility would make it even better. With minor fixes, this guide could be better to an even broader audience, from complete beginners to more experienced installers.
