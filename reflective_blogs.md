## Initial Thoughts

When first looking at the GNLIB (Graphic Novels in Libraries) website, it is clear that it differs from what a modern-day website looks like. Evidently, as shown in the image above, the website's landing page contains a large amount of text with a plain background. The page also lacks a visually appealing design.

It is difficult to navigate through the website because all the text links are the same—they are blue, underlined, and have the same font size. What stood out to me the most was the lack of images or graphics, and the website is very slow at loading pages when using the text links. 

## Modern vs. Early Web Design

- Layout and Navigation: The GNLIB's website uses a collection of text links scattered throughout the page to help the user navigate through the pages. This forces the user to go through a clutter of links, which creates a frustrating and challenging experience for users to navigate through the website. Modern-day websites offer navigation menus, often placed at the top or the side of the page. These menus help the user easily navigate through the website.

- Typography and Contrast: The GNLIB's website has small, inconsistent text that lacks proper spacing. The text colors also blend into the background, which may make it difficult for the user. Modern-day websites utilize larger, well-spaced fonts and high-contrast colors to make text stand out against the background, which will enhance the user's overall experience.

- Visual Appeal: The GNLIB's website has little to no graphics or images. This makes it feel that the website has no identity. The layout feels cluttered, and there is barely any use of white space. Modern-day websites have visually appealing designs with many images and graphics, which clearly show the identity of the website to the user.

## My Experience

Overall, my experience using this website felt weird and unusual. When using the website, I realized how much we take modern-day websites and all their new features for granted. It felt jarring to use a website that lacked usability and visual appeal. This made my experience frustrating because it required extra effort to navigate through the page. Some of the norms that we expect websites to have are navigation menus, fast response times, and efficient use of white space.
