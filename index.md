# Welcome to Elvie's Digital Portfolio 

## About Me 
Welcome to my Digital Portfolio! My name is Elvie Valmores. I am currently a junior at the University of Central Florida, pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Information Technology with a minor in Secure Computing and Networking. I am also part of the Bachelor's to Master's accelerated program at UCF, where I am taking courses toward a Master of Science in Cybersecurity and Privacy. After earning my Master’s degree, I plan to join the cybersecurity workforce as a Security Engineer.

In terms of work experience, I have worked as an Information Security Intern for Orange County Public Schools, where my responsibilities included configuring firewalls and web filters for schools across Orange County. Currently, I work as a Technical Specialist for Logic Controls, where I develop scripts to automate testing and software implementation across Windows, Linux, and Android systems—streamlining processes and improving efficiency.
